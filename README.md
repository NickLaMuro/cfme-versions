CFME::Versions.last.ruby
#=> "2.5.z"
CFME::Versions.last
#=> #<struct CFME::Version
#       miq_release="Jansa",
#       cfme_release="5.12.z",
#       cloud_forms_release="5.1",
#       ruby="2.5.z",
#       rails="5.2.z",

```


Contributing
------------

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on [GitHub][].

If you wish to add a version to the list, make sure to run the tests and fix
any errors as a result (designed to fail when things change).

You can use `rake` to run the specs as you would expect.
